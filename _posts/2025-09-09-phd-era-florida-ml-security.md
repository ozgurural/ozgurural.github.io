Embarking on a PhD in Florida means waking up to ocean breezes and the low rumble of aircraft testing engines at [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://www.erau.edu/). By 7 a.m. I am usually rolling past the flight line with a notebook full of model checkpoints to validate. Daytona Beach may be famous for NASCAR and spring breakers, but for me it has become a sanctuary of research punctuated by sunrise runs and late-night revisions to conference drafts.

My dissertation, **“Enhancing Proof-of-Learning Security Against Spoofing Attacks Using Model Watermarking,”** sits at the intersection of machine learning and security. Most mornings begin in the GPU lab, where I replay distributed training runs and stress-test watermarking strategies against the spoofing attacks we catalogue. Working on proof-of-learning protocols keeps me close to the questions that pulled me into graduate school: How do we know a model was trained honestly, and how do we protect that assurance when adversaries adapt?

I am fortunate to tackle those questions under the guidance of Dr. Kenji Yoshigoe and the research community inside the [Cybersecurity and Assured Systems Engineering center](https://erau.edu/research/cybersecurity-assured-systems). Weekly meetings there feel like mini-conferences, with faculty dissecting avionics incidents and classmates presenting fresh experimental results. I leave each session with new threat models to script and a renewed respect for the way secure AI touches everything from cockpit displays to satellite uplinks.

Florida’s climate supplies its own rhythm. Afternoon thunderstorms chase me from the lab only to leave sherbet-colored sunsets over the Halifax River. On clear nights we carpool south to watch a NASA or SpaceX launch, and the sight of a rocket carving through the sky has become my favorite antidote to research fatigue.

If you are considering a PhD journey that blends sun, sea, and cutting-edge research, ERAU offers a unique runway. Prospective students can explore programs and funding on the [Graduate Studies page](https://erau.edu/degrees/graduate). For those curious about securing AI, the book *Machine Learning and Security* by [Nate Foster and colleagues](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-and/9781491979897/) provides a practical starting point.

Research may keep me indoors, but Florida never lets me forget that discovery can be as expansive as the horizon beyond the runway—and that the best ideas often arrive somewhere between a lightning storm and a launch countdown.
