Embarking on a PhD in Florida means waking up to ocean breezes and the low rumble of aircraft testing engines at [Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University](https://www.erau.edu/). Daytona Beach may be famous for NASCAR and spring breakers, but for me it has become a sanctuary of research and late-night coding sessions fueled by caf√© con leche.

My research sits at the intersection of **machine learning** and **security**. Working with datasets from autonomous aircraft and campus networks, I build models that predict threats before they surface. Learning to secure AI systems is as important as making them accurate; frameworks like [adversarial machine learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.11256) guide much of my experimental design.

The ERAU campus thrives on collaboration. Faculty in the [Cybersecurity and Assured Systems Engineering center](https://erau.edu/research/cybersecurity-assured-systems) are never short on stories about defending critical infrastructure, and their insights shape how I evaluate risk in my own work. The constant hum of aviation research reminds me that our algorithms may one day sit inside cockpits or control towers.

Living in Florida adds its own flavor. Afternoon thunderstorms chase me from the lab, only to leave clear skies for evening walks along the Halifax River. The proximity to NASA and SpaceX launches on the Space Coast keeps me inspired and occasionally distracted.

If you are considering a PhD journey that blends sun, sea, and cutting-edge research, ERAU offers a unique runway. For prospective students, the [Graduate Studies page](https://erau.edu/degrees/graduate) provides an overview of programs and funding. And for those curious about securing AI, the book *Machine Learning and Security* by [Nate Foster and colleagues](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/machine-learning-and/9781491979897/) is a practical starting point.

Research may keep me indoors, but Florida never lets me forget that discovery can be as expansive as the horizon beyond the runway.
