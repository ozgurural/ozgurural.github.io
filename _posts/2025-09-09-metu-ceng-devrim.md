Middle East Technical University (METU) is a public research university in Ankara, Turkey, known for its emphasis on engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences [1]. Established in 1956, the university now offers 41 undergraduate programs across five faculties and hosts a large forested campus around Lake Eymir.

## The Computer Engineering Department

METU’s Department of Computer Engineering (CENG) was among the first of its kind in Turkey, formalized in 1977. It has since grown into a research-driven department with strengths in distributed systems, artificial intelligence, and computer graphics [2]. The program is conducted entirely in English and attracts students from across the country and abroad.

## Devrim Stage: A Symbol of Campus Spirit

At the heart of the campus lies the Devrim ("Revolution") Stage, an open-air amphitheater built by volunteer students in 1968. It has become a gathering place for graduation ceremonies, concerts, and peaceful demonstrations, reflecting the university’s culture of civic engagement [3]. Watching events from the concrete steps on a summer evening offers a glimpse into the spirit of collaboration and debate that defines METU.
