Middle East Technical University (METU) is officially described as a public research university in Ankara, Turkey, with sprawling forests and a focus on engineering, natural sciences, and social sciences [1]. Unofficially, it is the place that taught me how curiosity feels when it meets purpose. I still remember arriving for freshman orientation, hands wrapped around a steaming cup of sahlep, and watching the morning fog lift off Lake Eymir while upperclassmen debated robotics projects around me.

## The Computer Engineering Department

METU’s Department of Computer Engineering (CENG) was among the first of its kind in Turkey, formalized in 1977, and it shows in the culture [2]. Our Algorithms lectures met in a sunlit amphitheater where we diagrammed proofs on the board before racing downstairs to test them in the lab. Studio hours often stretched past midnight as we clustered around whiteboards in the CENG building, trading simulation tips and simit. The program’s English-medium instruction pulled in classmates from İzmir, Baku, and Berlin, turning project meetings into miniature Model UNs where we swapped both compiler tricks and recipes.

That collaborative spirit carried me from my bachelor’s capstone—an autonomous cargo drone prototype—to the cybersecurity research that defined my master’s thesis on detecting incidents in Turkish social media streams. I still keep the dog-eared notebooks from those years; they are filled with a mix of pseudo-code, Turkish idioms for data anomalies, and reminders to book lab time before the queues filled up.

## Devrim Stage: A Symbol of Campus Spirit

At the heart of campus lies the Devrim ("Revolution") Stage, an open-air amphitheater built by volunteer students in 1968. It is where I first presented a senior design demo under the stars and where graduation ceremonies still make even stoic engineers tear up [3]. On spring evenings the concrete steps fill with students unpacking bağlama performances, protest banners, or simply thermoses of tea. Sitting there, you feel the university’s culture of civic engagement humming in stereo, a reminder that the code we write is meant to serve a wider community.
