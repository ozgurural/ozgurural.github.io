Earlier this year I moved to a new neighborhood and was surprised by how long those first weeks felt. Every grocery run or bus ride demanded full attention. As routines settled, months began to blur together again. Cognitive science suggests this shift has less to do with age and more to do with how the brain encodes memories. When days look alike, the hippocampus compresses them into fewer distinct records, creating the impression that time has sped up[^1]. Conversely, a day rich with new experiences leaves more traces in neural storage, stretching our subjective timeline[^2].

The brain's "hard drive" does not simply fill sequential slots; it distributes patterns across networks. Research on interval timing indicates that perception of duration relies on a distributed system spanning the striatum, cerebellum, and prefrontal cortex, rather than a single clock mechanism[^3].

Novelty amplifies this encoding. Surprising stimuli trigger dopamine release, which strengthens synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal–VTA loop and enhances memory consolidation[^4]. This mechanism explains why traveling, trying new foods, or even taking a different route to work can make a week feel longer in hindsight.

To deliberately slow time, I try to seed diversity into otherwise ordinary routines:

* I rotate my commute, pedaling through alternate neighborhoods to create fresh spatial memories.
* I'm learning to play the guitar, a skill far outside my comfort zone, to activate new motor circuits.
* I schedule micro-adventures—like visiting an unfamiliar museum or park—to generate episodic richness.

These habits distribute experiences across multiple neural "directories," increasing retrieval cues and expanding our retrospective sense of duration. For me, intentionally sprinkling novelty into the week slows time and keeps curiosity alive. When I slip into autopilot, weeks vanish; with small experiments, I feel each day stretch. As neuroscientist David Eagleman notes, the more densely packed our memory book becomes, the longer the chapters appear[^5]. By cultivating novelty, we can counteract the feeling of life's fast-forward button and savor time more fully.
