Living as an expat has given me the chance to compare daily life in the United States and the Netherlands.

## Workâ€“Life Balance

Dutch workplaces generally emphasize balance, with shorter workweeks and more vacation time. In the U.S., longer hours are common, but there is often greater flexibility to change careers or move between cities.

## Transportation

Public transit and cycling rule in the Netherlands, making commutes predictable and healthy. In contrast, many U.S. cities are car-centric, which offers freedom but also brings traffic and parking challenges.

## Community

The Dutch tend to separate work and private life, keeping social circles small but loyal. Americans are often open to casual conversation and quick friendships, even if they remain surface-level.

These differences shape daily experiences and highlight the unique strengths of each culture.
