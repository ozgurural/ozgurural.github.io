Living as an expat has given me the chance to compare daily life in the United States and the Netherlands in a way no relocation checklist ever could. My Notion workspace is a mashup of Leiden grocery receipts, NS train schedules annotated with the Dutch words I still mispronounce, and lab to-do lists from Daytona Beach that smell faintly of jet fuel and cold brew. This post collects the lessons I keep returning to when friends message, "Should I move?" and when I have to remind myself why the country I'm not in still has my heart.

### At-a-glance Cheat Sheet

| Daily life axis | Netherlands (Leiden + frequent trains to Rotterdam) | United States (Daytona Beach + research trips) | Personal cheat code |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Commute baseline | 12-minute bike warm-up to Leiden Centraal + 32-minute Intercity with steady Wi-Fi; meeting invites default to 25-minute "train windows." | 18-minute drive when the Space Coast is sleepy; 40–45 minutes if it's raining, race week, or there's a rocket dress rehearsal. | Queue merge requests offline and reward yourself with a kiosk croissant; in Florida, stash granola + a charged SunPass to treat traffic like a boss level. |
| Workday rhythm | 36–40 hours with vacation buffers and colleagues who log off like they mean it. | 45–55 hours in grad-school crunch mode; "quick sync" translates to 7 p.m. Zoom. | Imported Dutch "log-off alarms" to Slack and keep the American appetite for audacious sprint goals—best of both calendars. |
| Coffee economy | €1.20 self-serve machine, optional stroopwafel, reliable focus achieved by cup two. | $5.35 cold brew plus tip because the barista remembers my thesis topic and my deadline. | Dutch savings flow into the travel fund; stateside I batch-brew between experiments to keep the espresso line from eating the day. |
| Time off reality | I actually take 24 of the 25 vacation days on offer, and HR cheers when I tack on an extra Friday. | "Unlimited" vacation turns into 10 real days after approvals, promises, and a polite "maybe after launch?" | Book the flight first, file the request second, and share the itinerary so teammates volunteer for coverage. |
| Health admin | One insurer, huisarts portal for refills in <24 hours, invoices with the calm energy of a mindfulness app. | Annual insurance scavenger hunt, three phone calls, and a spreadsheet of copays. | Living Notion database of policy numbers + scripts; play Dutch hold music for confidence before U.S. customer-service boss fights. |
| Weather mood swings | Gray skies, relentless drizzle, and a nation of cyclists who shrug and keep pedaling. | Humidity, 4 p.m. thunderstorms, and sun strong enough to recharge solar panels *and* my optimism. | Netherlands: midday SAD-lamp walk + rain cape in the pannier. Florida: gym sessions scheduled for storm o'clock and a car towel at the ready. |
| Community energy | Courtyard potlucks, slowly-earned invites, neighbors who notice when the bike shed isn't locked. | Coffee-line compliments, networking marathons, and a barista who tracks my workload by espresso shots. | Host stamppot nights in Leiden; send "coffee + whiteboard?" texts in Florida so both tribes stay warm. |

## Work–Life Balance

In Leiden, my mornings start with a bike ride toward the train that carries me to Avion Full Flight Simulators. Our engineering team builds flight-simulator software, and the culture is unapologetically focused on sustainable productivity. A sprint retro starts with "What will you do with your long weekend?" and code freezes really mean “log off.” Project leads shoo us out of Slack by 5:30 p.m., and it is normal to see sprint boards cleared by late afternoon so people can pick up their kids or make it to band practice.

Back in the U.S., my graduate research assistant days at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University stretched longer. Evening lab sessions were common, and journal submission deadlines had us refining proof-of-learning experiments well past midnight. When "only" working forty hours, I felt like I was sneaking out of class. I’ve learned to borrow the Dutch discipline for rest while keeping the American appetite for ambitious projects. The hybrid system looks like: protected focus time blocks, twice-weekly late-night experiments by choice, and all team rituals ending with action items *and* vacation reminders.

**Micro habits that stuck:**

- Block Friday afternoons for "bike + backlog"—ride to a café, process GitLab tickets, leave by 4 p.m.
- Put vacation time on the team calendar six weeks ahead. Dutch colleagues send celebratory emojis; American collaborators send "Approved" in triplicate.
- Monthly personal retro: Am I building simulators or just simulating life? The question keeps both countries' priorities aligned.

## Transportation & Mobility

Cycling everywhere in the Netherlands rewired my sense of distance. I measure days in canals crossed and count meetings by the number of times I’ve balanced my backpack on the rear rack before catching the intercity. The NS app is frighteningly accurate: if it promises a 07:58 departure, the train doors sigh shut at 07:58. I slot code reviews between Leiden and Rotterdam because there is dependable Wi-Fi and exactly enough time to draft a merge request.

In Florida, the car becomes my lifeline again. Daytona Beach has buses, but late-night lab work means driving to campus, blasting podcasts, and budgeting extra time for thunderstorms that slow down traffic. I keep a hurricane kit in the trunk next to a well-traveled badge lanyard. Dutch me swears by the OV-chipkaart and rail snacks; American me keeps quarters for toll booths and invests in windshield wipers the way others invest in index funds.

**Personally useful logistics:**

- Always carry a lightweight rain cape in the Netherlands; it doubles as wind protection when North Sea gusts turn the bike path into a physics experiment.
- In Florida, plan the day's first lab task as something solo—you will need recovery time after your commute plays chicken with I-95.
- Shared spreadsheet of fuel, train, and bike maintenance costs. Watching the Netherlands column stay greener than my Monstera plant motivates more pedaling.

## Bureaucracy & Paperwork

The Dutch pride themselves on systems, and once you survive the IND appointment, life becomes a barcode scan. Municipalities send tidy letters in Dutch that Google Translate handles graciously. I handle taxes via a wizard that politely asks if I truly mean to deduct a desk chair twice. Health insurance is one policy, not a choose-your-own-adventure novel.

The U.S. feels like boss-level administrative gameplay. Every January I assemble a binder titled "Insurance, maybe?" containing different logins for health, dental, vision, and lab access. University HR hotlines become acquaintances. The upside: American bureaucracy is oddly empowering once you accept it as a sport. I now document everything and have a template email titled "Friendly confirmation of coverage" that could win a Pulitzer for suspense.

## Food, Groceries, and Daily Costs

Albert Heijn receipts read like minimalist poetry: bread, kaas, paprika, hagelslag. Fresh produce is affordable and forces me to learn seasonal eating, which is Dutch for "white asparagus season is a lifestyle." Eating out feels special because €12 lunches are the norm and reservations matter.

In Daytona Beach, Publix is king, and my cart fills with greens, bagels, and the occasional key lime pie. Prices swing more dramatically—avocados can cost either 99 cents or a heartfelt apology to your budget. Eating out is easier on spontaneity: if it's Tuesday and I want tacos, odds are there's a neon sign ready to say yes. The cost I forget to plan for? Tipping math. My budgeting app now includes a "gratitude buffer" line so future me doesn't grumble while calculating 18% in the parking lot.

## Healthcare & Safety Nets

Healthcare is the question I get the most. In the Netherlands, I registered with a huisarts (family doctor) who knows my coffee order and my physical therapy exercises. Specialists are a referral away, prescriptions refill online in 24 hours, and bills arrive with the calm energy of a mindful breathing app. I pay a monthly premium, and that is the end of the mystery.

Stateside, I keep spreadsheets of copays, deductibles, and which clinic is "in network" this week. On the plus side, access to cutting-edge research hospitals is incredible; my grad program meant MRI machines down the hall and world-class researchers across the street. On the downside, I treat phone calls to insurance providers like prepping for a thesis defense.

## Weather, Mood, and Mental Health

Dutch winters are 50 shades of gray, but the country compensates with candles, indoor plants, and cafés that appear to have been decorated by hygge consultants. I learned to schedule midday light-therapy breaks and keep a gratitude log that includes "today I did not fall into a canal."

Florida weather is humid drama. Afternoon thunderstorms crash in, and the sun returns as if nothing happened. Vitamin D is plentiful; dehydration lurks. My coping mechanisms include iced coffee diplomacy and gym sessions timed to coincide with the daily rain so the drive home doubles as a free car wash.

## Community & Belonging

My Leiden neighbors keep their circles small but steadfast. The first time they invited me for stamppot felt like earning a long-term trust badge, and now our apartment courtyard doubles as a potluck venue every few months. We exchange birthday cakes, spare keys, and the occasional stern look when someone forgets to lock the bike shed.

In the U.S., strangers compliment your sneakers while you wait for coffee, and it’s easy to collect surface-level friendships in a weekend. Conferences turn into networking marathons, and the supermarket cashier knows when I have a deadline by the number of energy drinks on the belt. Both styles have taught me different versions of belonging—one built slowly around dinner tables, the other forged in spontaneous conversations after seminar talks.

## What I'm Keeping from Each Country

- **Dutch non-negotiables:** Sunday batch cooking, biking meetings when possible, taking every single vacation day, and calling colleagues at 4 p.m. just to say "log off." (They pretend to be annoyed; they're not.)
- **American superpowers:** Dream-big brainstorming, mentors who cheerlead across time zones, and the ability to assemble a cross-functional team over a single cup of coffee.
- **Universal lesson:** Home can stretch across two very different coastlines when you treat habits like carry-on luggage—pack light, swap freely, and leave room for souvenirs.

These differences shape daily experiences and remind me that both passports come with habits worth keeping. I’m still learning how to balance tulip-lined bike paths with launch-pad sunsets, and that's a good problem to have.
