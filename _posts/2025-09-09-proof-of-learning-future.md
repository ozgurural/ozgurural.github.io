Proof of Learning (PoL) verifies that a model was genuinely trained on claimed data by providing verifiable evidence of the training process. As machine learning systems become pervasive in critical domains, PoL offers a mechanism to ensure trust and accountability in model provenance.

### Why PoL Matters

1. **Model provenance** – PoL links models to their training data and processes, deterring plagiarism and unauthorized reuse.
2. **Regulatory compliance** – Governments and industries are moving toward regulations that demand auditable machine learning pipelines.
3. **Economic incentives** – Integrating PoL with blockchain allows useful training work to replace wasteful mining computations [5].

### Strengthening PoL

Our research explores model watermarking to protect PoL against spoofing attacks. Feature-based watermarking ties a model to its training data, making forgeries detectable [1]. A follow-up evaluation compares multiple watermarking approaches and analyzes robustness versus computational overhead [2]. The dissertation extends these findings and offers deployment guidelines for secure PoL pipelines [3]. Earlier survey work examines how blockchain mechanisms complement PoL in decentralized learning environments [4].

### Future Outlook

Emerging blockchain protocols employ PoL as a form of Proof-of-Useful-Work, demonstrating how verifiable training can secure decentralized networks while advancing machine learning [5,6]. As the demand for trustworthy AI grows, PoL will underpin open model markets, verifiable federated learning, and energy-efficient consensus systems.
