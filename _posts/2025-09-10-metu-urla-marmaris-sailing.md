Middle East Technical University's sailing club has long been a hub for students who love the sea. The club's team trains on the Aegean coast and connects students with Turkey's growing racing scene.

The Aegean coast hosts regattas that draw university crews and local sailors alike.


## Races on Turkey's Aegean Coast

- **Urla:** Home to the Aegean Offshore Yacht Club (EAYK), Urla hosts a packed calendar of weekend races and training regattas.
- **Marmaris:** Each autumn, the Marmaris International Race Week draws crews from across Europe for a week of intense competition.

## Key Roles on a Racing Sailboat

- **Helmsman:** Steers the boat and keeps it on course.
- **Tactician:** Plans the best route based on wind and competitors.
- **Trimmers:** Adjust sails for speed and balance.
- **Bowman:** Manages sails and lines at the front of the boat during maneuvers.
- **Pit:** Coordinates lines and halyards between deck and cockpit.
- **Navigator:** Tracks position and course, especially on longer offshore legs.
