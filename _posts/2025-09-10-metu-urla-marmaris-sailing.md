**From the Helm**

Competitive sailing is a masterclass in high-stakes teamwork where split-second decisions matter. It teaches you to trust your crew implicitly and communicate with absolute clarity under pressure ("Communication beats heroics"). I have found these patterns apply directly to Incident Management and Engineering Ops.

Middle East Technical University's sailing club has long been a hub for students who love the sea. I joined the club about six years ago, eager to escape Ankara's dry inland climate, and spent nearly every free weekend on the Aegean. I'm not a member today, but the lessons still stick. Learning to call sail trim and feeling the hull surge after a clean tack gave me my first taste of real teamwork.

Those early regattas taught me more than boat handling. We planned our own logistics, from borrowing a van for the sails to cooking pasta in the parking lot after long practice days. Keeping a race journal of what went right and wrong became a habit I still lean on, even if my time on the water is a few years behind me.


## Races on Turkey's Aegean Coast

1. **Urla:** Home to the Aegean Offshore Yacht Club (EAYK), Urla hosts a packed calendar of weekend races and training regattas, including the annual [Jimmy Key Cup](https://jimmykeycup.com). Afternoon thermals can die without warning, so we learned to bank a lead early.
2. **Bodrum:** BAYK's [Baykar Winter Trophy](https://www.bayk.org), sponsored by Baykar, keeps crews sharp through the off-season in Bodrum's sheltered waters. Gusts funneling off the hills reward crews who trim quickly.
3. **Marmaris:** Each autumn, the Marmaris International Race Week draws crews from across Europe for a week of intense competition. The long downwind legs here taught us to trust the spinnaker and stay patient.

## Lessons from the Cockpit

1. Telltales are the boat's heartbeat, glance at them every few seconds.
2. Communication beats heroics; call your moves early and clearly.
3. If you have time to relax, you have time to coil a line.

## Key Roles on a Racing Sailboat

1. On our boat I often trimmed the jib, but rotating through each position taught me how every role matters.
2. **Helmsman:** Steers the boat and keeps it on course. A calm helm keeps the crew focused during hectic pre-starts.
3. **Tactician:** Plans the best route based on wind and competitors, often with one eye on the compass and one on the fleet.
4. **Trimmers:** Adjust sails for speed and balance; I learned to watch the leeward telltales and feather in gusts.
5. **Bowman:** Manages sails and lines at the front of the boat during maneuvers, leaping like a cat to set or douse the spinnaker.
6. **Pit:** Coordinates lines and halyards between deck and cockpit, keeping the chaos organized.
7. **Navigator:** Tracks position and course, especially on longer offshore legs, and keeps a log for later debriefs.

## What Stayed with Me

Leaving the club didn't mean leaving the habits behind. The discipline of double-checking knots shows up in my code reviews, and the calm breathing before a start line helps when stepping into tough meetings. Even without a crew around me, I still watch the flags and clouds out of sheer reflex.
