Middle East Technical University's sailing club has long been a hub for students who love the sea. I was lucky to sail with the club when I was a student at METU, spending weekends trimming sails on the Aegean and getting hooked on the rhythm of race starts.

Those early regattas taught me how vibrant and welcoming Turkey's Aegean racing scene can be.


## Races on Turkey's Aegean Coast

- **Urla:** Home to the Aegean Offshore Yacht Club (EAYK), Urla hosts a packed calendar of weekend races and training regattas, including the annual [Jimmy Key Cup](https://jimmykeycup.com).
- **Bodrum:** BAYK's [Baykar Winter Trophy](https://www.bayk.org), sponsored by Baykar, keeps crews sharp through the off-season in Bodrum's sheltered waters.
- **Marmaris:** Each autumn, the Marmaris International Race Week draws crews from across Europe for a week of intense competition.

## Key Roles on a Racing Sailboat

- On our boat I often trimmed the jib, but rotating through each position taught me how every role matters.
- **Helmsman:** Steers the boat and keeps it on course.
- **Tactician:** Plans the best route based on wind and competitors.
- **Trimmers:** Adjust sails for speed and balance.
- **Bowman:** Manages sails and lines at the front of the boat during maneuvers.
- **Pit:** Coordinates lines and halyards between deck and cockpit.
- **Navigator:** Tracks position and course, especially on longer offshore legs.
