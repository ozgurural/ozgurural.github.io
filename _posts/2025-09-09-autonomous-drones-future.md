Previously, I worked for about two years on a project developing autonomous drone systems, focusing on platforms such as Kargu and Togan. These systems illustrate how rapidly unmanned technologies are advancing and why they will play a critical role in future security and civilian applications.

### Emerging Platforms

- **Kargu** – a loitering munition capable of autonomous target engagement, providing tactical units with precision strike capabilities. [STM product page](https://www.stm.com.tr/en/products/kargu).
- **Togan** – a small rotary-wing surveillance drone offering extended endurance and modular payloads for situational awareness. [STM product page](https://www.stm.com.tr/en/products/togan).

### Future Importance

Autonomous drones reduce the burden on human operators while expanding mission possibilities. As AI and sensor technologies mature, platforms like Kargu and Togan will support disaster response, border protection, and infrastructure monitoring. Their ability to operate in swarms, share data, and execute complex tasks will define the next era of aerial robotics.
