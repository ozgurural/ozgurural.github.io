Between February 2019 and November 2020, I served as an Expert Software Engineer at STM Defence Technologies in Ankara, building operational software for the Kargu loitering munition and the Togan reconnaissance UAV. My focus was the mission-control and ground-control software stack: I architected distributed modules in modern C++ with Boost, Qt, and QML; implemented intuitive operator interfaces so pilots could re-task swarms in seconds; and authored power-on and continuous built-in tests that verified flight-critical subsystems before each sortie. Working shoulder to shoulder with avionics, payload, and field-test teams taught me how to translate tactical requirements into resilient code that keeps crews safe.

That hands-on work made the rapid maturation of autonomous drones tangible. We iterated on perception pipelines, cooperative behaviour modes, and contested-environment resilience at a pace that traditional defense programs rarely achieve. Kargu’s ability to execute precision loitering missions and Togan’s modular sensor suite for persistent ISR both stem from an ecosystem of real-time telemetry, secure comms, and human-in-the-loop safeguards that we tuned over countless flight trials. Delivering those capabilities highlighted the broader shift: autonomy is no longer a research prototype—it is a deployable force multiplier.

Looking forward, I see the next wave of autonomous drones extending far beyond defense. The same swarm coordination and self-diagnostic frameworks we hardened for military use will anchor civilian applications in disaster response, infrastructure inspection, environmental monitoring, and logistics. Marrying trustworthy autonomy with distributed machine-learning safeguards (the focus of my later doctoral research) will be essential to ensure these fleets remain robust against spoofing and tampering. Platforms like Kargu and Togan are early signals of how intelligent aerial systems will reshape security, emergency management, and even daily city operations in the coming decade.

### Platforms I Helped Build

- **Kargu** – an autonomous loitering munition capable of precision engagement with onboard target recognition. [STM product

- **Togan** – a rotary-wing surveillance drone offering modular payloads and extended endurance for situational awareness.

### Why Their Future Matters

Autonomous drones reduce cognitive load on human operators while expanding mission possibilities. As AI-driven perception,
edge compute, and secure mesh communications mature, the next generation of platforms will collaborate in swarms, share
telemetry with ground and cloud systems, and self-heal when components degrade. Whether safeguarding borders, mapping wildfire
perimeters, or delivering urgent supplies, their ability to act as agile, intelligent teammates will define the next era of aerial
robotics.
