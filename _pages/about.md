Meet Ozgur Ural - a seasoned software engineer, trusted team leader, and innovative researcher. Currently, Ozgur is pursuing his Ph.D. in Computer Science at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University while serving as a Graduate Research Assistant. His research focuses on the intersection of smart contracts and machine learning, exploring proof of learning for optimal model selection.

With nearly a decade in the technology sector, Ozgur has honed his skills across cybersecurity and autonomous systems. He is well-versed in an array of programming languages, including but not limited to C++20, C, Python, Java, JavaScript, and Bash. Familiar with both Linux and Windows operating systems, he's adept at leveraging version control and CI tools like Git, Jenkins, Bamboo, and SonarQube, and methodologies such as Agile and Test-Driven Development.

Before transitioning into research, Ozgur spearheaded a software team at Havelsan, where he played a critical role in developing the Data Leakage Prevention product's endpoint agent. He further honed his expertise as an Expert Software Engineer at STM Defence Technologies and Comodo Cybersecurity, gaining hands-on experience in desktop app development, computer security, cryptography, network security, and autonomous systems.

Ozgurâ€™s educational background includes a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering and Computer Science from Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University (in progress), an M.Sc. in Cyber Security, a B.Sc. in Computer Engineering from Middle East Technical University, and a BBA from Anadolu University.

A regular contributor to academic dialogue, Ozgur's research has been recognized in several conference proceedings. His pursuit of excellence is demonstrated by numerous accomplishments, such as an impressive score on the Quantitative Reasoning section of the GRE in 2021, a first-place finish in The Scientific and Technological Research Council of Turkey's National Project Competition in 2014, and a second-place finish in Middle East Technical University's Graduation Projects Competition the same year.
