I’m a Senior Software Engineer and researcher with 10+ years of experience delivering enterprise-scale systems and leading cross‑functional teams. I completed a Ph.D. (August 2025) in Secure & Distributed Machine Learning at ERAU, focusing on proof‑of‑learning protocols, model watermarking, and distributed ML systems. I build high‑reliability software for real‑time simulators and cloud services, translate research into production, and enjoy solving hard problems across cybersecurity, aerospace, and cloud platforms.

Highlights:
- Real‑time simulator software (C/C++, multithreading, synchronous comms).
- Cloud services and web apps (Scala, TypeScript/JavaScript, Svelte, Python, gRPC/Protobuf, Redis, PostgreSQL).
- CI/CD and ops (Docker, GitLab CI/CD).
- Research: proof‑of‑learning, ML watermarking, blockchain‑enhanced ML.
