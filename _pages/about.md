**Driving Innovation in Secure AI & High-Reliability Systems**

I am a **Senior Software Engineer, Researcher, and Technical Leader** with over a decade of experience architecting enterprise-scale systems and leading high-performance cross-functional teams.

Holding a **Ph.D. in Secure & Distributed Machine Learning**, I bridge the gap between advanced academic research and mission-critical industrial applications. My expertise lies in designing proof-of-learning protocols, robust distributed systems, and real-time simulation software where failure is not an option.

As a leader, I specialize in translating complex research into production-ready solutions, mentoring engineering talent, and driving technical strategy for cloud and aerospace platforms.

Highlights:
- **Leadership**: Leading cross-functional teams to deliver critical infrastructure and high-reliability software.
- **Research Authority**: Pioneering research in Proof-of-Learning, ML Watermarking, and Blockchain-Enhanced ML.
- **Engineering Excellence**: Architecting cloud-native services (Scala, TypeScript, gRPC) and real-time C++ simulation kernels.
