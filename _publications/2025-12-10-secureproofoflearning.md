SecurePoL presents a dual-layer framework that couples immutable Proof-of-Learning logs with three watermarking strategies (feature-based triggers, sparse parameter perturbations, and a non-intrusive auxiliary head), ensuring verification succeeds only when both the training trajectory and watermark are consistent.
